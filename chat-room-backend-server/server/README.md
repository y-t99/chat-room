# Getting Started

This project is the chat room's backend server.

## APIs Doc

The project use Spring REST Docs for APIs. The aim of Spring REST Docs is to help you produce accurate and readable documentation for your RESTful services.

Spring REST Docs uses snippets produced by tests written with Spring MVC’s test framework, Spring WebFlux’s WebTestClient or REST Assured 5. This test-driven approach helps to guarantee the accuracy of your service’s documentation. If a snippet is incorrect, the test that produces it fails.

Documenting a RESTful service is largely about describing its resources. Two key parts of each resource’s description are the details of the HTTP requests that it consumes and the HTTP responses that it produces. Spring REST Docs lets you work with these resources and the HTTP requests and responses, shielding your documentation from the inner-details of your service’s implementation. This separation helps you document your service’s API rather than its implementation. It also frees you to evolve the implementation without having to rework the documentation.
