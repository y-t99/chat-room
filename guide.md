## Concept

1. What is Matrix?

Matrix is an open network for secure and decentralized communication, it's a Instant messaging protocol. Users from every Matrix homeserver can chat with users from all other Matrix servers. You can even use bridges (also called Matrix Appservices) to communicate with users outside of Matrix, like a community on Discord[^1].

Matrix will be a better choice for applications like Slack â€“ those that support communication around organized groups or topical conversations[^2].

2. What is Matrix Specification?

The Matrix Specification is a document describing interactions between the various components of the Matrix ecosystem (homeservers, clients, appservices). For a given feature, implementation details may vary, but Matrix aims for a consistent behaviour and wants to avoid the need for negotiation between parties[^3].
